# Mask R-CNN for Object Detection and Segmentation
To integrate the Mask R-CNN functionality into your HMM (Hidden Markov Model) repository, you can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Integration

1. **Clone the Repositories**
   First, make sure you have both repositories cloned locally. If you haven't already done so, clone them using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/whatheheckisthis/hmm-repo.git
   git clone https://github.com/whatheheckisthis/mask-rcnn-repo.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the HMM Repository**

   ```bash
   cd hmm-repo
   ```

3. **Create a New Directory for Mask R-CNN Integration**

   Create a new directory in your HMM repository to store the Mask R-CNN code and any related files:

   ```bash
   mkdir mask_rcnn_integration
   ```

4. **Copy Mask R-CNN Files**

   Copy the necessary files from the Mask R-CNN repository into the newly created directory:

   ```bash
   cp -r ../mask-rcnn-repo/mrcnn mask_rcnn_integration/
   cp ../mask-rcnn-repo/mask_rcnn_coco.h5 mask_rcnn_integration/
   cp ../mask-rcnn-repo/requirements.txt mask_rcnn_integration/
   ```

5. **Create an Integration Script**

   In the `mask_rcnn_integration` directory, create a script named `integrate_mask_rcnn.py` that will handle the integration of Mask R-CNN with your HMM models. This script will perform object detection and segmentation and then use the results with your existing HMM.

   ```python
   # mask_rcnn_integration/integrate_mask_rcnn.py

   import os
   import sys
   import numpy as np
   import cv2
   import tensorflow as tf
   from mrcnn import utils
   from mrcnn import model as modellib
   from mrcnn import visualize
   from mrcnn.config import Config

   # Path to Mask R-CNN weights
   MODEL_DIR = os.path.dirname(__file__)
   COCO_WEIGHTS_PATH = os.path.join(MODEL_DIR, "mask_rcnn_coco.h5")

   class MaskRCNNConfig(Config):
       NAME = "mask_rcnn_config"
       GPU_COUNT = 1
       IMAGES_PER_GPU = 1
       NUM_CLASSES = 1 + 80  # COCO has 80 classes + background
       STEPS_PER_EPOCH = 100
       VALIDATION_STEPS = 5

   def run_mask_rcnn(image_path):
       config = MaskRCNNConfig()
       model = modellib.MaskRCNN(mode="inference", model_dir=MODEL_DIR, config=config)
       model.load_weights(COCO_WEIGHTS_PATH, by_name=True)

       image = cv2.imread(image_path)
       results = model.detect([image], verbose=1)
       r = results[0]

       # Process and visualize results
       visualize.display_instances(image, r['rois'], r['masks'], r['class_ids'], 
                                    config.CLASS_NAMES, r['scores'])

       # Example: Save results
       result_image_path = os.path.join(MODEL_DIR, "result.jpg")
       cv2.imwrite(result_image_path, image)
       print(f"Results saved to {result_image_path}")

       # Integrate results with HMM here
       # (Implementation depends on your specific HMM code)
       # ...

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       if len(sys.argv) != 2:
           print("Usage: python integrate_mask_rcnn.py <image_path>")
           sys.exit(1)

       image_path = sys.argv[1]
       run_mask_rcnn(image_path)
   ```

6. **Update `requirements.txt`**

   Add the Mask R-CNN dependencies to your `requirements.txt`:

   ```
   tensorflow>=1.3.0
   opencv-python
   matplotlib
   scipy
   numpy
   mrcnn
   ```

7. **Integrate Mask R-CNN Results with HMM**

   Update your existing HMM code to use the results from the Mask R-CNN integration. This will involve processing the detection results and using them in your HMM models. For example:

   ```python
   # hmm_model.py (Example snippet)

   def update_hmm_with_mask_rcnn_results(mask_rcnn_results):
       # Process Mask R-CNN results
       # Update HMM models accordingly
       pass
   ```

8. **Test the Integration**

   Run the integration script to ensure everything is working correctly:

   ```bash
   python mask_rcnn_integration/integrate_mask_rcnn.py path_to_your_image.jpg
   ```

   Ensure that the Mask R-CNN outputs are correctly used in your HMM models.

9. **Commit and Push Changes**

   After verifying that the integration works as expected, commit the changes to your repository:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Integrate Mask R-CNN with HMM"
   git push origin main
   ```

This process will integrate Mask R-CNN functionality into your HMM repository, allowing you to leverage advanced object detection and segmentation capabilities alongside your existing HMM models.

Integration of Mask R-CNN with SAL’s Lane Detection and Driver Monitoring Systems
