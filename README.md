#SAL

React Native + Google Vision API mobile application to identify objects in pictures taken using an android phone. Technically could also be compiled into an ios app but needs testing.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies by running
```
npm install
```
Get an API key for Google Cloud Vision [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials), then replace it in config.json
```
"apiKey": "please_enter_your_api_key_here"
```

To run in debug mode (youd need to connect an actual android device that can be found with adb)
```
react-native run-android
```

### Prerequisites

You'd need 
* Android SDK (Easiest to download everything with [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)) 
* npm or yarn
* Your own Google Cloud Vision Api key. Get one [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
