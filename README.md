# Mask R-CNN for Object Detection and Segmentation

To adapt the Mask R-CNN model to fit SAL's Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), the approach will involve integrating the model as an algorithm within SAL’s core technology. This includes incorporating the implementation into the main repository and leveraging NVIDIA CUDA for optimized performance.

Configure TensorBoard for logging and visualization to monitor training progress and model performance.
Code Implementation
Repository Integration:

Add the Mask R-CNN implementation to the main SAL repository:
bash
Copy code
# Clone the Mask R-CNN repository
git clone https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN.git

# Copy necessary files to SAL's main repo
cp -r Mask_RCNN/mrcnn SAL/mrcnn
cp Mask_RCNN/samples/coco/coco.py SAL/samples/coco/coco.py
CUDA Configuration:

Ensure the environment is configured to utilize NVIDIA CUDA for training:
bash
Copy code
pip3 install tensorflow-gpu
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1  # Adjust based on available GPUs
Training and Evaluation Scripts:

Add scripts for training and evaluating the integrated Mask R-CNN model:
python
Copy code
