SAL is an advanced software solution aimed at enhancing the safety and driving experience on New Zealand's roads. By integrating state-of-the-art lane detection technology, SAL offers a seamless and effective way to monitor lane adherence, helping drivers maintain safe driving practices. Our goal is to provide this innovative tool free of charge for vehicles undergoing their next Warrant of Fitness, contributing to safer and more reliable roadways across New Zealand.


## Overview

**SAL** SAL (Save a Life) is an advanced software solution designed to enhance road safety by leveraging cutting-edge lane detection technology and real-time driver monitoring. Developed using state-of-the-art statistical analysis and modeling techniques, SAL aims to proactively prevent accidents caused by unintended lane departures and driver inattentiveness.

## Key Features

Advanced Lane Detection: Utilizes Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to achieve precise lane detection with accuracy rates exceeding 90%. SAL reliably identifies lane boundaries and tracks vehicle positioning under diverse environmental conditions.
Real-Time Driver Monitoring: Incorporates Bayesian inference and machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests, to model and predict driver behavior. This allows for the detection of distractions and drowsiness, enabling proactive safety interventions.
Seamless Integration: Integrates via a dedicated microchip that processes up to 1000 data points per second, facilitating real-time decision-making and adaptive control. SAL supports seamless integration with existing vehicle systems without the need for additional hardware.
Simulation and Validation: Validated through Monte Carlo simulations replicating real-world driving scenarios, demonstrating a 30% reduction in lane departure incidents. Simulation metrics include mean time between failures (MTBF) and risk reduction percentages.

## Installation

To install and use **SAL**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SAL.git
    cd SAL
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Build the Project**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

4. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

Start the Software: Ensure that SAL is running and properly connected to your vehicle’s onboard diagnostic system. Verify the integration through the software interface.

Monitor Lane Detection: Observe SAL’s lane detection capabilities as it processes real-time video feeds from the vehicle's cameras. The system will display lane boundaries and vehicle positioning on the dashboard interface.

Respond to Alerts: Pay attention to any corrective actions or alerts issued by SAL. These alerts are designed to assist in maintaining safe driving practices by notifying the driver of potential lane departures or signs of driver inattentiveness.
