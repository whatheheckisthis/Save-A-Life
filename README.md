## Introduction

SAL aims to provide a robust compliance service by detecting lanes and monitoring driver behavior in real-time. This project combines the power of Mask R-CNN for object detection and segmentation with HMM and GMM for sophisticated data analysis and decision-making.

## Features

- **Lane Detection**: Advanced algorithms for accurate lane detection.
- **Driver Monitoring**: Real-time analysis of driver behavior.
- **Object Detection and Segmentation**: Integrates Mask R-CNN for precise object detection.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes HMM and GMM for robust data analysis.
- **CUDA Support**: Leverages NVIDIA CUDA for enhanced performance.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- CUDA (for GPU support)
- Required Python packages

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/whatheheckisthis/sal.git
cd sal
Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download Mask R-CNN Weights
Download the pre-trained Mask R-CNN weights and place them in the root directory:

bash
Copy code
wget https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/releases/download/v2.1/mask_rcnn_coco.h5
Usage
Running the Integration Script
The mask_rcnn_integration.py script integrates Mask R-CNN with SAL's HMM and GMM models. To run the script, follow these steps:

Ensure you have an example image in the root directory named example.jpg.
Execute the script:
bash
Copy code
python mask_rcnn_integration.py
The script will load the image, perform object detection and segmentation using Mask R-CNN, update the HMM and GMM models, and print the combined results.

Example Output
plaintext
Copy code
Detection and segmentation results: {...}
