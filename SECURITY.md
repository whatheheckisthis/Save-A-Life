### Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability in any of our supported versions, please report it promptly to ensure it is addressed. You can submit your report via email to [saldevs.team@gmail.com](mailto:saldevs.team@gmail.com)

When you report a vulnerability, you can expect the following:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will confirm receipt of your report within 48 hours.
2. **Assessment**: Our team will evaluate the issue and determine its severity. This process typically takes 7-14 days.
3. **Update**: We will provide updates on the status of your report and inform you of any progress or resolutions within 30 days of submission.
4. **Resolution**: If the vulnerability is accepted, we will work on a fix and notify you once a patch or update is available. If declined, we will explain our decision.

Your contributions help us maintain the security and integrity of our project. 

Thank you for your vigilance and support.
